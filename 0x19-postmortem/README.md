ssue Summary:
On March 7th, 2023, between 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM EST, our online shopping platform experienced an outage that resulted in slow page load times, frequent errors, and some users being unable to complete transactions. Approximately 20% of our users were affected by this outage. The root cause of this issue was a database overload caused by a surge in traffic.

Timeline:

2:00 AM EST: The issue was detected when our monitoring system alerted us to increased error rates and slower page load times.
2:15 AM EST: The engineering team investigated the issue and found that the database was experiencing high load and was not responding to queries in a timely manner.
2:30 AM EST: The team assumed that the root cause of the issue was an increase in traffic to the platform.
3:00 AM EST: The team investigated the load balancer and server logs for any anomalies but found nothing out of the ordinary.
3:30 AM EST: The team attempted to scale up the database, but this did not resolve the issue.
4:00 AM EST: The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team.
4:30 AM EST: The senior engineering team identified that a surge in traffic was the root cause of the issue and recommended implementing rate limiting to prevent database overload.
5:00 AM EST: Rate limiting was implemented, and the platform was back to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a surge in traffic that caused the database to become overloaded and unresponsive. The resolution was to implement rate limiting to prevent the database from being overloaded. This involved configuring the load balancer to limit the number of requests that could be sent to the database in a given time frame. By limiting the number of requests, we were able to prevent the database from becoming overloaded, which resolved the issue.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent a similar issue from occurring in the future, we will be taking the following corrective and preventative measures:

Implement more robust monitoring to detect database overload and other anomalies.
Improve our capacity planning to ensure that our database can handle expected traffic surges.
Implement additional rate limiting measures to prevent database overload.
Conduct regular load testing to ensure that our platform can handle increased traffic.
Create a detailed incident response plan to ensure that we can quickly and efficiently respond to any future incidents.
Task List:

Update monitoring system to detect database overload (by March 15th)
Conduct capacity planning analysis (by March 31st)
Implement additional rate limiting measures (by April 15th)
Conduct load testing (by April 30th)
Create incident response plan (by May 15th)
In conclusion, the outage that occurred on March 7th, 2023, was caused by a surge in traffic that overloaded our database. We were able to resolve the issue by implementing rate limiting measures, and we have taken corrective and preventative measures to prevent a similar issue from occurring in the future.
